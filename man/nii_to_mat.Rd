\title{Convert a 4D NIfTI image to a matrix}
\usage{
nii_to_mat(ni_in)
}
\arguments{
\item{ni_in}{Path to a NIfTI file where the x dimension encodes variables and the 4th (time) dimension encodes observations.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimension \code{time x variables}.
}
\description{
Reads a 4D NIfTI file (with singleton y and z dimensions) and converts it to a matrix
with dimensions \code{time x variables}. This is the inverse of \code{mat_to_nii()}.
}
\details{
Assumes the input image has shape \code{[x, 1, 1, time]} as produced by \code{mat_to_nii()}.
