\title{Construct BIDS-Compatible Filenames from Extracted Entity Data}
\usage{
construct_bids_filename(bids_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{bids_df}{A \code{data.frame} containing one or more rows of BIDS entities.
Must include at least the columns \code{suffix} and \code{ext}, and optionally:
\code{subject}, \code{session}, \code{task}, \code{acquisition}, \code{run}, \code{modality}, \code{echo},
\code{direction}, \code{reconstruction}, \code{hemisphere}, \code{space}, \code{resolution},
\code{description}, and \code{fieldmap}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of reconstructed BIDS filenames, one per row of \code{bids_df}.
}
\description{
Given a data frame of BIDS entities (as returned by \code{extract_bids_info()}),
this function reconstructs filenames following the BIDS specification.
It supports standard BIDS entities including subject, session, task, run,
acquisition, space, resolution, and description, along with the suffix and file extension.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  subject = "01", task = "rest", space = "MNI152NLin6Asym",
  resolution = "2", description = "preproc", suffix = "bold", ext = ".nii.gz",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
construct_bids_filename(df)
# Returns: "sub-01_task-rest_space-MNI152NLin6Asym_res-2_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz"
